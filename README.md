# Data-Analysis-Internship
This repository features projects completed during my Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies (Feb 2024 â€“ Mar 2024). The work includes restaurant trend analysis, geographic mapping, and pricing distribution. I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and problem-solving with large datasets, extracting meaningful insights to improve decision-making.
Below is a breakdown of the tasks completed at Level 1 and Level 2 of the internship:

**Level 1:**

**Task 1:** Top Cuisines
Determined the top three most common cuisines in the dataset. 
Calculated the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.

**Task 2:** City Analysis
Identified the city with the highest number of restaurants. 
Calculated the average rating for restaurants in each city.
Determined the city with the highest average rating.

**Task 3:** Price Range Distribution
Created a histogram/bar chart to visualize the distribution of price ranges among restaurants.
Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

**Task 4:** Online Delivery
Determined the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
Compared the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.



**Level 2:**

**Task 1:** Restaurant Ratings
Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings and identified the most common rating range.
Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

**Task 2:** Cuisine Combination
Identified the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset.
Determined if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

**Task 3:** Geographic Analysis
Plotted the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates.
Identified patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

**Task 4:** Restaurant Chains
Identified if there are any restaurant chains present in the dataset.
Analyzed the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.
