# Data-Analysis-Internship
This repository features projects completed during my Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies (Feb 2024 â€“ Mar 2024). The work includes restaurant trend analysis, geographic mapping, and pricing distribution. I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and problem-solving with large datasets, extracting meaningful insights to improve decision-making.
